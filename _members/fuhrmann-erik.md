Erik started his journey with his BSc in Biology from the Leibniz University of Hannover. Afterwards, he recieved his M.Sc. from Hannover Medical School (MHH) in Biomedical Data Science and is currently enrolled at the MHH Biomedical Data Science (BIOMEDAS) PhD program. His researching interests lie in studying the regulation of poly(A)-tail lengths and RNA modifications in viral contexts using computational approaches. If he's not currently exploring the world of bioinformatics he's likely exploiting it in (4X) strategy games.
