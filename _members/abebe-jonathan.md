(Outdated description.)

Jonathan studied bioengineering at the University of California, Irvine with an emphasis in computer science. Before joining the Depledge Lab, Jonathan spent time in a genetic engineering lab where he developed and applied CRISPR-Cas9 based technologies to therapeutically correct disease models.  

Jonathan's current project involves the development of a computational tool (NAGATA) that will enable users to automate viral transcriptome annotations using nanopore Direct RNA Sequencing (DRS) datasets.
Previously, he developed a tool (DRUMMER) that enabled the identification of RNA modifications at nucleotide-level resolution and with transcript isoform level specificity.

Outside of lab Jonathan enjoys playing video and board games and, when the situation is right, amature astronomy. Additionally, he enjoys reading all things sports and comic books.
