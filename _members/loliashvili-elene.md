Before starting her PhD, Elene obtained a bachelor's degree in biology from the Agricultural University of Georgia and a Master's degree from the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich where she studied Molecular and Cellular Biology and produced a thesis on the characterization of antiviral innate immune signaling using spatial proteomics at Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry.
For her PhD project in the Depledge Lab, she is studying the epitranscriptomic regulation of Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) infection. The aim of the project is to examine the role of m6A and other RNA modifications in regulating VZV infections.
