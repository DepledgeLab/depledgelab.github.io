Pierina obtained her BSc in Biotechnology from the Universitat Politècnica de València and later a Msc in Research in Immunology from the University of Granada. She's previously worked with RNA viruses at the I2SysBio and, during her stay at the Depledge Lab, she'll study HSV transcriptomics using nanopore sequencing approaches. Outside the lab Pierina spends her time plotting murder mystery stories, making music with her rock band, or running.
