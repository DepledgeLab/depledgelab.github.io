# Welcome to the Depledge Lab!

Research in the Depledge Lab (aka Systems Biology of Virology lab) is focused on understanding how human herpesviruses persist following infection. The role of RNA biology is a particular focus and we apply diverse molecular and computational biology techniques to study this while also developing novel sequencing approaches and new softwares for computational analysis.
