# Welcome to the Depledge Lab!

The Depledge Lab focuses on understanding how human herpesviruses persist following infection and how this is influenced by different aspects of RNA biology. Here, exciting web-lab, high performance computing bioinformatics and supportive colleagues meet to create new research. Have a look around this website to find out more!
