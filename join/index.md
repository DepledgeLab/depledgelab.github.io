Our lab works at the intersection of molecular and computational virology and we are always looking for persons with expertise in one and/or the other. We welcome applicants from any race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, gender identity, gender expression, caregiver and family commitments, political affiliation, sexual orientation, and eligible age or disability status. Furthermore, we are committed to maintaining a supportive and collaborative lab environment.

We are always in the market for motivated and talented people, even if we do not have an open position currently advertised. We are interested in engaging with you in a conversation about your scientific background and goals for your future career (in academia, industry, or other ventures). We strive to provide excellent training across a wide range of computational and experimental techniques. If interested please send your CV/Resume to [Dan](/contact).

### Master's students
We are proud to host students enrolled in the [MHH Biomedicine, Biomedical Data Science, and Infectious Disease + One Health (IDOH) programs](https://www.mhh.de/en/all-degree-programs) for both short (3-6 week) and long (up to 6 months) projects.

### PhD Students
At the MHH, most PhD students are recruited via the [DEWIN/ZIB](https://www.mhh.de/hbrs/zib) graduate program which offers a 3-year PhD program in which candidates who pass the interview stages are able to select from a set of projects submitted by group leaders from departments around the MHH. Scholarship awards (including [DAAD](https://www.daad.de/en/studying-in-germany/scholarships/daad-scholarships/)) are available for students who score highly at the interview stage.
